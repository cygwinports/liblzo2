sdesc: "LZO data compression library"
ldesc: "LZO is a data compression library which is suitable for data
de-/compression in real-time. This means it favours speed
over compression ratio.

LZO is written in ANSI C. Both the source code and the compressed
data format are designed to be portable across platforms."
